    :markdown
        For Medicare services under better access, you will need a referral
        from a GP, paediatrician or psychiatrist, and a mental health care
        plan. If you’re seeking a referral from a GP, remember to book a
        longer consultation.

        You can receive up to 10 individual consultations and 10 group
        sessions per year for Medicare approved services.

        We can guide you through the process of getting a referral, including
        providing a letter to your GP or referring practitioner.
