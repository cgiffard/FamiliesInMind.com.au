  You don’t need a referral to come and see us — but you will need one
  in order to claim a Medicare rebate.
</h2>
<p>
  For best results, especially for matters involving babies and young
  children, a separate referral for both parent and child enables us to
  work with the parent and child as needed.
</p>
<h2>Need a Referral?</h2>
<p>With the appropriate referral, rebates may be available under<strong>Medicare Better Access.</strong>Rebates may also be available via your private health fund.</p>
<h4 class="upper">Medicare</h4>
<p>
  For Medicare services under better access, you will need a referral
  from a GP, paediatrician or psychiatrist, and a mental health care
  plan. If you’re seeking a referral from a GP, remember to book a
  longer consultation.
</p>
<p>
  You can receive up to 10 individual consultations and 10 group
  sessions per year for Medicare approved services.
</p>
<p>
  We can guide you through the process of getting a referral, including
  providing a letter to your GP or referring practitioner.<a href="/contact">Contact us for more information.</a>
</p>
<h4 class="upper">Private Health Cover</h4>
<p>
  Consultation services may be covered under your private health
  insurance. Please see your health insurance provider for more
  information.
</p>
<h2>Looking to refer?</h2>

  If you are a GP, paediatrician, or psychiatrist, you can make a
