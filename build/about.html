<h1>About Our Organisation</h1>
<p class="intro">
  Families in Mind is a Canberra based specialist psychological practice
  experienced in working with expectant families or families with young
  children who are showing behavioural or emotional difficulties.
</p>
<p class="intro">
  Research tells us that in order to address these issues, we need to
  look at the broader picture. Our therapeutic approach takes into
  account family relationships — both as a way of understanding these
  challenges, and working with you to make things better.

<p>
  Our own experience with becoming parents and raising our children
  gives us some understanding of how it feels to adjust to parenthood,
  and the struggles that parenting sometimes brings.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes children’s behaviour can be confusing — but we’ve learnt
  that their behaviour is the way they communicate how they feel and
  what they need from us. Some children and families have had a
  difficult start or experienced setbacks, which can make things harder.
</p>
<p>
  We’re here to help by working with you to get a better understanding
  of what might be going on for your child. If you’re expecting a child,
  we can help smooth the transition to parenthood.
</p>
<h4>Working Together</h4>
<p>
  We can tailor the way we work to meet the needs of families or
  professionals. We are able to provide individual consultation, group
  programs as well as supervison, assessment, training, consultancy and
  research collaboration.
