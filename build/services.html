  <p><strong>We can provide individual and group sessions.</strong>As we are a team of three psychologists we can accommodate several
    members of one family in concurrent individual sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Group programs may be run periodically when there is adequate
    demand.
  </p>
  <p>
    The evidence based therapeutic approach we take with each client
    will depend on presenting difficulties, assessment and the goals
    we set with you.
